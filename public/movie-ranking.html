        <h3>Spiderman into the spiderverse</h3>
            <p>This was a great movie with a great character developement <br />

        <h3>Kung fu panda</h3>
            <p>Another movie with great character developement, Po has to<br />
            rebuild himself, change all the things he hates about himself<br />
            and work hard to became what he always dreamed of.</p>
        <h3>Batman Lego</h3>
            <p>Batman is a tough guy, that can do everything by himself, <br />
            but he has a lonely life, he doesn't like to open up with others<br />
            or allow himself to love someone or maintain a relationship <br />
            with anyone. At the end he learns that it's good to have someone <br />
